## How to run
Run **The Final Solution** file 

The numbering coming in the python exe file can be ignored and please until it gets completed

New files with name allot and stats will be created(replacing the existing files)

## Best solution
I had run the program several time and then saved the best three solution I have get.

The metric to rank various solution is defined in  PDF file 

## METRIC TO RANK BEST SOLUTION:
1)	While running the file , some data are been printed , the data shows iteration no. output variable in best solution till now and new output on current iteration 
2)	So when it stops the last printed value will help us to rank our solution (relative ranking)
3)	To see printed  text run the code in VSCODE
